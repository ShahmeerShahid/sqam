## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Folder Structure <a name = "folder_structure"></a>
- components/
	- ExampleComponent/
		- index.js
